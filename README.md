# AnimeManager
I made from my Raspberry Pi anime downloader. Whenever new episode is avaiable, it automatically donwloads it. The problem is that i had to delete watched episodes by myself, so i wrote this Python script, which deletes every video in given directory older than 5 days.

### Usage: main.py path_to_directory
